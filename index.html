	<h1>MÃ©lanie Thierry</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD Candidate in Ecology at the Biology Center CAS in <a href="http://lab.hrcek.net/">Jan Hrcek's lab</a>.</p>
	<p>I am a community ecologist interested in understanding the processes behind the structure and dynamics of natural communities. I am particularly fascinated by the ecology of parasitoids.</p>
	<p>In my PhD, I investigate the role of different types of species interaction and warming in shaping and stabilizing host-parasitoid networks. I use an empirical approach with laboratory experiments on a wild-caught tropical _Drosophila_-parasitoid community and a theoretical approach with mathematical models.</p>
	<p>I am also involved in a global collaborative <a href="www.lifewebs.net">LifeWebs project</a> aiming to investigate how interaction networks respond to latitude, elevation and human pressures as a data manager for host-parasitoid interaction data.</p>
