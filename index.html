	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		I am a community ecologist interested in understanding the processes behind the structure and dynamics of natural communities. 
		I am particularly fascinated by the ecology of parasitoids.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I am currently a PhD Candidate in Ecology at the Biology Center CAS in <a href="http://lab.hrcek.net/">Jan Hrcek's lab</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my PhD, I investigate the role of different types of species interaction and warming in shaping and stabilizing host-parasitoid networks. 
		I use an empirical approach with laboratory experiments on a wild-caught tropical <i>Drosophila</i>-parasitoid community,
		and a theoretical approach with mathematical models.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am also involved in the collaborative <a href="www.lifewebs.net">LifeWebs project</a> 
		aiming to investigate how interaction networks respond to latitude, elevation and human pressures as a data manager for host-parasitoid interaction data.
