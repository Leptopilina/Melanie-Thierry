	<p>
		I am a community ecologist interested in understanding the mechanisms behind the structure and dynamics of natural communities, 
		especially in the context of global change. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I recently defended my PhD in Ecology at the Biology Center CAS in <a href="http://lab.hrcek.net/" target="_blank">Jan Hrcek's lab</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In my PhD, I investigated the effects of the biotic context and future climate warming on host-parasitoid communities. 
		I used an empirical approach with laboratory experiments on a wild-caught tropical <i>Drosophila</i>-parasitoid community that I helped establish in our lab in Czech Republic.
		I have also started to develop a theoretical approach with mathematical models.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I am involved in the collaborative <a href="http://www.lifewebs.net/" target="_blank">LifeWebs project</a> 
		aiming to investigate how interaction networks respond to latitude, elevation and human pressures as a data manager for host-parasitoid interaction data.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I was born and raised in Montpellier, France.
		Outside work and insect interactions, I love spending time in nature either hiking, running, or climbing.
