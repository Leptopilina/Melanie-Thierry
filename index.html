		I am an ecologist interested in understanding the mechanisms behind the structure and dynamics of communities in the context of environmental changes. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I am currently a post-doc researcher at CNRS <a href="https://sete-moulis-cnrs.fr/" target="_blank">SETE</a>. 
		I investigate phenotypic and dispersal plasticity in response to environmental flutuations using an experimental approach in microcosms. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I defended my PhD in ecology in September 2021 at the Biology Center CAS in <a href="http://lab.hrcek.net/" target="_blank">Jan Hrcek's lab</a>.<br>
		
		In my PhD, I investigated the effects of the biotic context and future climate warming on host-parasitoid communities. 
		I used an empirical approach with laboratory experiments on a wild-caught tropical <i>Drosophila</i>-parasitoid community that I helped establish in our lab in Czech Republic.<br>

		I was also involved in the collaborative <a href="http://www.lifewebs.net/" target="_blank">LifeWebs project</a> 
		aiming to investigate how interaction networks respond to latitude, elevation and human pressures as a data manager for host-parasitoid interaction data.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I was born and raised in Montpellier, France.
		Besides ecology, I love exploring and spending time in nature, either hiking, climbing or running.
