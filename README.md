## About

I'm a PhD Candidate in Ecology at the Biology Center CAS in [Jan Hrcek's lab](http://lab.hrcek.net/). 
I am a community ecologist interested in understanding the processes behind the structure and dynamics of natural communities. I am particularly fascinated by the ecology of parasitoids. 
In my PhD, I investigate the role of different types of species interaction and warming in shaping and stabilizing host-parasitoid networks. I use an empirical approach with laboratory experiments on a wild-caught tropical _Drosophila_-parasitoid community and a theoretical approach with mathematical models. 
I am also involved in a global collaborative [LifeWebs project](www.lifewebs.net) aiming to investigate how interaction networks respond to latitude, elevation and human pressures as a data manager for host-parasitoid interaction data.
